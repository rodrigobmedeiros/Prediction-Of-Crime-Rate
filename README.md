# Prediction of crime rate

## Introdução

This analysis is based on the dataset `uscrime` -> [link to download](http://www.statsci.org/data/general/uscrime.txt).
The idea is to develop a predictive model capable of calculating the crime rate based on the other variables present in the dataset.

## Description

Criminologists are interested in the effect of punishment regimes on crime rates. This was studied using aggregated data from 47 US states in 1960. The data set contains the following columns:

## Variables - Description

- M - Percentage of males aged 14–24 in total state population.
- So - Indicator variable for a southern state.
- Ed - Mean years of schooling of the population aged 25 years or over.
- Po1 - Per capita expenditure on police protection in 1960.
- Po2 - Per capita expenditure on police protection in 1959.
- LF - Labour force participation rate of civilian urban males in the age-group 14-24.
- M.F - Number of males per 100 females.
- Pop - State population in 1960 in hundred thousands.
- NW - Percentage of nonwhites in the population.
- U1 - Unemployment rate of urban males 14–24.
- U2 - Unemployment rate of urban males 35–39.
- Wealth - Median value of transferable assets or family income.
- Ineq - Income inequality: percentage of families earning below half the median income.
- Prob - Probability of imprisonment: ratio of number of commitments to number of offenses.
- Time - Average time in months served by offenders in state prisons before their first release.
- Crime - Crime rate: number of offenses per 100,000 population in 1960.

## About this project

This is an end-to-end project going through all stages from exploratory analysis, selection of variables to the development of a regression model. Object orientation techniques were applied to abstract process steps.
